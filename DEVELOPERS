TOP SECRET ------ DEVELOPERS ONLY ------- TOP SECRET

So, if you're reading this document, you must be a developer, or some kind of
super hacker who managed to checkout from the (public) Arch repository.

This package is based on the GNU Autotools, automake, autoconf, libtools, etc.

The tree stored within the Arch archive needs to be "bootstrapped" in order to
be "configure"able and compilable. The bootstrap script "bootstrap" will run
aclocal, automake, autoconf, etc. in order to prepare the tree.
