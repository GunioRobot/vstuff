TOP SECRET ------ DEVELOPERS ONLY ------- TOP SECRET

So, if you're reading this document, you must be a developer, or some kind of
super hacker who managed to checkout from the (public) bazaar repository.

This package is based on the GNU Autotools, automake, autoconf, libtools, etc.

The tree stored within the bazaar archive needs to be "bootstrapped" in order to
be "configure"able and compilable. The bootstrap script "bootstrap" will run
aclocal, automake, autoconf, etc. in order to prepare the tree.


Release process
---------------

This is a checklist to remind me the steps to release a new version:

For each tree in which there may there be some uncommitted changes do a
"bzr status", check and eventually commit.

- Create a new branch for the release train:

VERSION=X.Y
TREE=sftp://vstuff@repo.visdn.org/~/vstuff/release-$VERSION

bzr branch vstuff-devel $TREE

- Checkout locally the newly created branch

bzr checkout $TREE vstuff-release-$VERSION

cd vstuff-release-$VERSION
vim configure.ac
bzr commit -m "Version set"

./bootstrap
./configure
make release
