FEATURES/NOTES

- The socket MUST be bound to an interface to function properly.

- The socket layer supports multiple sockets on TE interfaces. A TEI is assigned
  to each socket for complete transparency between different q.931 speakers.

TODO

- Add lapd_ptr to struct net_device. Currently we're using atalk_ptr and it is
  safe, since ISDN interfaces will never run AppleTalk, however it is an ugly
  hack and should be fixed.

- Add AF_LAPD to linux/include/linux/socket.h
- Add PF_LAPD to linux/include/linux/socket.h
- Add SOL_LAPD to linux/inclode/linx/socket.h ????

- Add ARPHRD_LAPD to linux/include/linux/if_arp.h
- Add ETH_P_LAPD to linux/include/linux/if_ether.h

- The interface role (in the ISDN network) is determined by the IFF_ALLMULTI flag.
  - A specific flag would be better.

- Fix all copyright notices and file headers

- Check what headers/parts should be included by user-mode programs (#ifdef KERNEL)

- Use Automake/Autoconf for chan_isdn

- Implement SOCK_RAW sockets (?)

- Use SOCK_SEQPACKET instead of SOCK_DGRAM? (we must remain in TCP_CONNECTED state)

- Check all input data in ioctls/setsockopt for security bugs

- Implement socket closure after timeout and T203

FIX debugging
Add interface to each line

Check what happens when 64 sockets are open (every dynamic TEIs)

Notes:
In NT mode there is only one TEI management entity per interface

In TE mode there can be at most one TEI management per socket

Missing:
ECT (explicit call transfer) (ETS 300 369-1) (367, 368, 369)
