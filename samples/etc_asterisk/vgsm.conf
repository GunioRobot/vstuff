;
; vGSM-II configuration file for Asterisk's chan_vgsm channel driver
;
; The [general] section is reserved for parameters which are driver-wide
;
; The [global] section contains parameters definition which is applied by
; default to all the interfaces but may be overridden in interface-specific
; sections.
;
; All the other sections represent individual GSM modules. You can name them
; as you please althought 'general' and 'global' are reserved.
; The name will be used in Dial() application parameters to select the outbound
; module. 
;
; Alternatively, if prefixed by 'hungroup:' an entry describes a huntgroup.
; The hunting method is specified by:
;
; mode = sequential
;               (sequential | rotary)
;       Type of hunting to perform in the hungroup
;
; members = ""
;       List the members (interface names) belonging to the huntgroup.
;       The order is preserved in the hunting process.
;
; Here follows the configuration directives available in [global] and
; module-specific sections.
; 
; sms_spooler =
;	This parameter specifies the pathname of the script which will handle
;	SMS and CBM messages. A description of the spooler input is available
;	at http://open.voismart.it/index.php/VGSM_Spooler
;
; sms_spooler_pars =
;	The parameters indicated in this directive get passed on the spooler's
;	command line
;
; rx_gain = 255
;	Codec gain for the analog receive path
;	[vGSM-I only.]
;
; tx_gain = 255
;	Codec gain for the analog transmit path
;	[vGSM-I only.]
;
; set_clock = yes
;	Set the internal GSM module's clock to the current time. This is
;	recommended as the module's RTC is not powered.
;
; sms_sender_domain =
;	Since /usr/sbin/sendmail may be used as a SMS spooler, you may want
;	to attach a valid domain to the sender's number in the From: header.
;	This parameter specifies such domain.
;
; sms_recipient_address =
;	To use a SMTP spooler the To: header is also required. This parameter
;	allows you to specify it.
;
; dtmf_quelch =
;
; dtmf_mutemax =
;
; dtmf_relax =
;
; poweroff_on_exit =
;	If you do not wish to turn off GSM modules when terminating Asterisk
;	set this parameter to 'off'. It is mostly useful for debugging
;	purposes.
;
; device =
;	The character device controlling the main serial of the GSM module.
;	For vGSM-I the main serial is named /dev/vgsmX (with X=0,1,2...)
;	For vGSM-II the main serial is named /dev/vgsm/<cardname>_meX
;	(with X=module number, 0, 1, 2 or 3).
;
; pin =
;	To automatically send the PIN to the GSM module use this parameter.
;	The automatic mechanism will prevent sending the PIN to the module
;	if only one attempt is left.
;
; context =
;	Inbound calls will be initiated in the specified context.
;
; operator_selection = auto
;	Instructs the GSM module to perform the specified operator selection.
;	Valid values are:
;	auto:
;		Automatically select operator's network
;	manual:
;		Forces selection of the operator specified in operator_id
;		parameter.
;	manual_fallback:
;		Forces selection of the operator specified in operator_id;
;		If such operator cannot be found or registration fails, the
;		GSM module falls back to automatic mode.
;
;	deregistered:
;		The module remains de-registered
;
; operator_id =
;	Specifies the operator ID to use in manual and manual_fallback modes
;	as LAI (Location Area Identifier) numeric format. The LAI is comprised
;	of the concatenation of MCC+MNC (Mobile Country Code + Mobile Network
;	Code). For example, the Vodafone Italy's LAI is 22210.
;
; amr_enabled = true
;	Allow presentation of AMR bearer capability. Setting this parameter
;	to false will prevent the AMR codec to be used.
;
; gsm_hr_enabled = true
;	Allow presentation of half-rate GSM CODEC in the bearer capability.
;	Setting this parameter to false will prevent the HR codec to be used.
;
; gsm_preferred = fr
;	Set the preferred GSM CODEC. Valid values are 'fr' (full-rate), 'hr'
;	(half-rate)
;
; === The following parameters are reserved to expert users ===
;
; tx_calibrate = 32767		[0..32767]
;	Calibrate TX audio level with the formula:
;	Gain in dB = 20 * log (tx_calibrate / 32767)
;
; rx_calibrate = 16383		[0..32767]
;	Calibrate RX audio level with the formula:
;	Gain in dB = 20 * log (2 * rx_calibrate / 32767)
;
; jitbuf_low = 10
;	Tunes the lowlevel jitter buffer low-watermark
;
; jitbuf_high = 300
;	Tunes the lowlevel jitter buffer high-watermark
;
