; network_role = private
;		(user | private | local | transit | international)
;	The role of the interface in the ISDN network. Normally you would use
;	"private" to indicate a private branch. If you ever want to be seen as
;	the public operator you should use "local". "transit" and
;	"international" are mostly unused.

; type_of_number = unknown
;		(unknown | international | national | network_specific |

;	Context: global, interface
;	Role: Network, User
;
; local_type_of_number = unknown
;		(unknown | international | national | network_specific |
;		subscriber | abbreviated)
; 	Type of number used for caller id. Some network require you to use a
;	specific type of network to correctly accept the caller_id.
;	Context: global, interface
;	Role: Network, User
;
; overlap_sending = Yes
;	Enables/disables overlap dialing. Disabiling overlap dialing means
;	that the called party number in the SETUP message is considered

;	be rejected. Note that "sending" means that the user is sending digits.

; overlap_receiving = No
;	Enables/disables overlap receiving on the interface. Overlap receiving
