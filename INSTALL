Installation Instructions
*************************

Installing vISDN is not strightforward. I've made my best to keep it as
self-contained and unintrusive as possible but, after all, this is a
complete ISDN architecture which involves and hooks to many subsystems.

Step 1: Configure the build system

cd into the untarred package tree and run ./configure

If you are (and you probably are) compiling kernel modules, make sure
you have the current running kernel sourcetree in /usr/src/linux that
you have compiled at least once.

Usually "make modules_prepare" should be enough but I prefer to do
"make cloneconfig" and "make" to have full symbol versions.

Step 2: Compile everything

Run "make" and check that everything gets compiled correctly.

Step 3: Install

Run "make install"

Step 4: Configuration
