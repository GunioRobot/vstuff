Installation Instructions
*************************

Installing vISDN is not strightforward. I've made my best to keep it as
self-contained and unintrusive as possible but, after all, this is a
complete ISDN architecture which involves and hooks to many subsystems.

Step 1: Configure the build system

cd into the untarred package tree and run ./configure

If you are (and you probably are) compiling kernel modules, make sure
you have the current running kernel sourcetree in /usr/src/linux that
you have compiled at least once.

Usually "make modules_prepare" should be enough but I prefer to do
"make cloneconfig" and "make" to have full symbol versions.

NOTE: Fedora Core 3's 2.6.11 kernel has some 2.6.12 patches which introduce
incompatible interface changes. Since they offer no way to know what
changes have been introduced, if you're using that kernel you will probably
need to add --with-kernel-have-sk-prot flag to configure invocation.

Step 2: Compile everything

Run "make" and check that everything gets compiled correctly.

Step 3: Install

Run "make install"

Step 4: Configuration
