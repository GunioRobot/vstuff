Installation Instructions
*************************

Installing vISDN is not strightforward. I've made my best to keep it as
self-contained and unintrusive as possible but, after all, this is a
complete ISDN architecture which involves and hooks to many subsystems.

-------------------------------------
Step 1: Configure the build system
-------------------------------------

cd into the untarred package tree and run ./configure

NOTE: Fedora Core 3's 2.6.11 kernel has some of the 2.6.12's patches
which introduce incompatible interface changes. Since they offer no way to
know what changes have been introduced, if you're using that kernel you will
probably need to add --with-kernel-have-sk-prot flag to configure invocation.

-------------------------------------
Step 2: Compile everything
-------------------------------------

Run "make" and check that everything gets compiled correctly.

-------------------------------------
Step 3: Install
-------------------------------------

Run "make install", if you "configure"d it correctly, kernel modules will
be installed in the appropriate /lib/modules/ subdirectory, asterisk
modules will be installed in Asterisk's modules directory and so on for
pppd plugin, configurations, etc.

Run:

depmod -a

In order to update the modules dependencies

udev
----

vISDN infrastructure and modules make use of several character devices
which should be created in /dev.
A udev ruleset is available as etc/udev/30-visdn.rules, it should be
installed in /etc/udev/rules.d or equivalent, before attempting to
load the modules.

hotplug
-------

Some distribution's (notably SuSE) net hotplug scripts may interfere
with the initialization of vISDN, you may see the interfaces go
down when you register them. I addedd an exception for visdn* interfaces
in /etc/hotplug.d/net/50-ifup.hotplug to avoid it.

-------------------------------------
Step 4: Configuration
-------------------------------------

A proper hotplug script is still missing, a manual configurator has been
included.

The configurator is installed
