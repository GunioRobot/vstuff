Warning: Improper firmware flashing may render your card unusable and require
         replacement.

Note: During firmware programming, the flash memory contents remains invalid
      until completed. In case of power loss or system failure the card will
      become unusable and should be factory reprogrammed by means of a
      programming cable.

All the firmware changes are described in this changelog, there is no need
to upgrade the firmware unless you are experiencing one of the issues described
below.

Changelog:

------ 2.8.3 ------

- Fixed rx-fifo counter setting when switching from slin to x-law. Software
  workaround should make this fix not needed.

------ 2.8.2 ------

- Allow controlling the SIM's VCC through the DTR line. Some SIM does not get
  reset properly if the proper power-up sequence is not followed.

------ 2.8.1 ------

- Ignore pulled up lines when the ME is powered off, otherwise spurious IRQs
  may be generated up to the point to severy slow down or hang the system.

------ 2.8.0 ------

- INTA# and SERR# were incorrectly output on the bus as two-state outputs,
  leading to unreliable interrupt reporting when shared with other boards.
- Upgraded PCI compiler to 7.1
- Used derived clock for DAI clock, removing the need to synchronize between
  clock domains.
- Removed debugging features

------ 2.7.0 ------

- Increased UART FIFO size to 256 bytes inbound/512 bytes outbound
- Fixed UART overrun reporting
- Fixed LED output security to be more responsive and immune to aliasing

------ 2.6.3 ------

- Fixed unreliable SIM initialization on power-on

------ 2.6.2 ------
- Status LEDs (red/green) were switched

------ 2.6.1 ------
- If the SIM UARTs were misconfigured while the ME was directly connected to
  a SIM, the SIM-ME communication could have been disrupted.

------ 2.6.0 ------
- First firmware release
