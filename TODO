General:
--------

- Check what headers/parts should be included by user-mode programs
  (#ifdef KERNEL)
- Check all input data in ioctls/setsockopt for security bugs
- Document functions (with doxygen?)
- Create a libvisdn for channel manipulation functions?
- Define in which contexts all the various functions may be called. For example
  ppp needs ppp_input() to not be called in hard-irq context and we either must
  force all vISDN xmit functions callers to not be in hard-irq context or queue
  frames in visdn-ppp.ko and use a tasklet to pass them to ppp

Build system:
-------------

- Avoid libtool to install chan_visdn.a, chan_visdn.la, run ldconfig and
  complain about non-standard directory location
- Conditionally build kfifo!

chan_visdn:
-----------

- When the module fails initialization, forbid calls and report an error
- Complete hunt groups support, handle failed calls and failed interfaces
- Record call failures and failure type in order to put an interface offline
  if not working.
- Make call parking feature enabling configurable
- The network should be able to refuse certain bearer capabilities
- Fix/complete Progress indicators to notify interworking with non-ISDN
- Fix autocompletion in cli commands
- MWI on ISDN phones
- Asterisk's design makes difficult to implement some sort of parameter
  negotiation so it is impossible to know what bearer capabilities are
  accepted by a destination, if it supports overlap dialing and so on...
- Call bumbing
- Check DTMF handling

libq931:
--------

- Restart Procedure is completely untested, test it.
- ECT (explicit call transfer) (ETS 300 369-1) (367, 368, 369)
- Call bumbing
- Implement Called/Calling party subaddress IE
- Implement Congestion level IE
- Implement Keypad facility IE
- Implement Low layer compatibility IE
- Implement More Data IE (?)
- Implement Network-specific facilities IE
- Implement Repeat Indicator IE
- Implement Segmented Message IE (?)
- Implement Signal IE
- Implement Transit Network Selection IE
- Implement User-User Information IE
- Implement ETS 300 125 Appendix III (Optional basic access deactivation
  procedures)

app_visdn_ppp:
--------------

- Handle hangup

timer:
------

- Add open/release functions to disable the timer when no users are using it

visdn_core:
-----------

- Channel bundling
- Allocate a single major number for control devices?
- Reconnection does not work

lapd:
-----

- Implement automatic TEI check for TEIs that are presumably unused and could
  be released

- When allmulti flag is changed while the interface is UP, Tei Mgmt entities
  are not released/allocated correctly. The interface needs to be put down and
  than up to make it work

- Implement SOCK_RAW sockets (?)

- Implement listen backlog maximum size

- Implement frame acknowledging throught outgoing i-frames instead of specific
  RR

- Check what happens when 64 sockets are open (every dynamic TEIs)

- Add lapd_ptr to struct net_device. Currently we're using atalk_ptr and it is
  safe, since ISDN interfaces will never run AppleTalk, however it is an ugly
  hack and should be fixed.

- Add AF_LAPD to linux/include/linux/socket.h
- Add PF_LAPD to linux/include/linux/socket.h
- Add SOL_LAPD to linux/inclode/linx/socket.h ????

- Add ARPHRD_LAPD to linux/include/linux/if_arp.h
- Add ETH_P_LAPD to linux/include/linux/if_ether.h
- See ioctl-number.txt and mail <mec@shout.net> and register an IOCTL numbers

- The interface role (in the ISDN network) is determined by the IFF_ALLMULTI
  flag, a specific flag would be better.

- Implement ETS 300 125 Appendix III (Optional basic access deactivation
  procedures)

-------

- FIX FIFO free calculation and queue handling
- Finish PCM bus support
- Reintegrate E-channel sniffing
