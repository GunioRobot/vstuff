General:

- Fix all copyright notices and file headers
- Check what headers/parts should be included by user-mode programs (#ifdef KERNEL)
- Correctly implement automake/autoconf/libtool for every subsystem
- Check all input data in ioctls/setsockopt for security bugs


chan_visdn

- Implement contexts in visdn.conf
- Implement groups in visdn.conf
- Fix/complete Progress indicators to notify interworking with non-ISDN


libq931

- Fix hangup after T312 expiration in multipoint links

- Implement: 5.9 User notification procedure

- Restart Procedure is completely untested, test it.

- ECT (explicit call transfer) (ETS 300 369-1) (367, 368, 369)


visdn_core

- Complete PPP support


lapd/netdev

- There is a deadlock/race condition on modules removal when an application
  has an open socket and doesn't exit immediately

- Implement point-to-point and static TEIs

- Implement automatic TEI check for TEIs that are presumably unused and could
  be released

- Implement SOCK_RAW sockets (?)

- DL_DATA-REQUEST in AWAITING shoud put the frame in queue

- Lock accesses to TME and make tei atomic_t  (?)

- Implement socket closure after timeout and T203

- Implement listen backlog maximum size

- Implement frame acknowledging throught outgoing i-frames instead of specific RR

- Indagate whether it is possiblle to strictly serialize frames coming from the
  same device (and thus going to the same socket). Currently netif_rx spreads the
  load on per-CPU queues and frames may get analyzed concurrently.

- Check what happens when 64 sockets are open (every dynamic TEIs)

- Should we add incoming interface, interface role and packet_type to ethereal's
  frame?

- Add lapd_ptr to struct net_device. Currently we're using atalk_ptr and it is
  safe, since ISDN interfaces will never run AppleTalk, however it is an ugly
  hack and should be fixed.

- Add AF_LAPD to linux/include/linux/socket.h
- Add PF_LAPD to linux/include/linux/socket.h
- Add SOL_LAPD to linux/inclode/linx/socket.h ????

- Add ARPHRD_LAPD to linux/include/linux/if_arp.h
- Add ETH_P_LAPD to linux/include/linux/if_ether.h
- See ioctl-number.txt and mail <mec@shout.net> and register an IOCTL number

- The interface role (in the ISDN network) is determined by the IFF_ALLMULTI flag.
  - A specific flag would be better.

hfc-4s

- We may be able to avoid interrupt disabling in hfc-4s by removing every
  hardware access from the interrupt handler and serializing accesses to
  hardware with semaphores.
